# Read Me - MET CS 601 Sheena Shahangian

To run this program, please open "calculator.html" in your browser. Rather than having an alert immediately pop up, I have created a landing page that introduces the program and tells the user how it works. There is a button that says "Let's Begin" that you can press to begin the program.

## Requested Elements



### Incorporation of Other Additional Elements - How I Went Above and Beyond

I've attempted to add some new features beyond the standard requirements listed in the rubric. These include: 
* Using CSS, I have styled the landing page that the user goes to, so they are welcomed to a pretty page, rather than immediately encountering an alert upon opening the page. Per my research and the professor's comment in class, it looks like alerts cannot be styled. Thus, I have not styled those.
* I have performed checks to ensure the input is a valid number, using the isNan() method.
* I have used the onclick event for the "Let's Begin" button to start the program.
* I have tested my program in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure it works as expected in multiple browsers.
* I have thoroughly commented all of my code, to make it easy to understand and come back to in the future.
